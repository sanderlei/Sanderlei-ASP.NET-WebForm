     Germany, Adolf Hitler formulated and adopted by the government of Germany from 1933 to 1945. This period became known as Nazi Germany. Nazism is often considered by scholars as a derivation of fascism. Even incorporating common elements of both the political right and the political left, Nazism is considered extreme right. The Nazis were one of several historical groups that used the term National Socialism to describe themselves and, in 1920, became the largest group in Germany. The ideals of the National Socialist German Workers Party are expressed in its Programme of 25 points, proclaimed in 1920. Among the key elements of Nazism, there is the pan-Germanism, racism, anti-Semitism, anti-communism, totalitarianism and opposition to economic and political liberalism. </p><p>
In the 1930s, Nazism was not a monolithic movement, but rather a combination of various ideologies and philosophies mainly focused on nationalism, anti-communism and the traditionalism. Some groups initially were part of the Nazi movement. One of his motivations was dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles, which was understood as a Jewish - Communist conspiracy to humiliate Germany at the end of the  World War I. The evils of postwar Germany were critical to the formation of ideology. The Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933. </p><p>
In response to the instability created by the Great Depression, the Nazis sought a third way to manage the economy of their country, which had not capitalist or communist ideals. The Nazi government effectively ended on May 7, 1945, when the Nazis unconditionally surrendered to the Allied powers, who took the administration of Germany until the country formed their own democratic government. </p><p>
Is Nazism led by Adolf Hitler responsible for the Holocaust was the genocide of six million Jews during World War II, through a systematic program of ethnic cleansing sponsored by the Nazi state. </p><p>
Of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe before the Holocaust, approximately two-thirds were killed. A network of more than 40,000 installations in Germany and Nazi-occupied territories was used to concentrate, operate, maintain and kill Jews and other victims. </p><p>
The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages. Several laws to exclude the Jews from civil society was enacted in Germany before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were set up for forced labor and the Germans were transporting Jews to extermination camps where they were systematically killed in gas chambers.
