Human evolution is the evolution of homo sapiens as a distinct species from other hominids(apes). The term "human" in the context of human evolution refers to the genus Homo which includes modern humans and their close relatives (all extinct). The first individuals of the genus Homo appeared around 2.5 million years ago and evolved into Homo sapiens around 200,000 years ago.
