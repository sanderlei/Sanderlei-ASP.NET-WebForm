With an army of Prussian and other German states military, Prussia commanded the invasion and conquest of France. William I was proclaimed Emperor of Germany in 1871, thus completing the unification of Germany. The main consequences of German unification of Germany were military, and economic development; growing geopolitical power of Germany in Europe, Germany Entry in dispute over territory in the neo-colonization of Africa and Asia and the formation of the Triple Alliance in 1882 process, political- block military consists of Austria, Italy and Germany.
