It is a mainly decorative art being the main works of this style building facades, decorative objects, jewelry, stained glass and tiles. In the late nineteenth century rural exodus, the development of communications and electricity, coupled with urban growth led to the emergence of the culture of fun. This culture the bourgeoisie gained social status through the cabarets, where it was possible to find the fusion of elements of high culture with the elements of the lower classes.</p><p>

This was possible due to the development of electricity and reduction of the workday, causing workers to have more free time for leisure.</p><p>
All this golden age lasted until the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914.
