               1911 with the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.</p><p>
The Chinese revolution was motivated by anger at corruption in the Qing government, frustration with the government's inability to restrain the interventions of foreign powers, and resentment of the majority Han Chinese ethnic be dominated by an ethnic minority Manchu.</p><p>
The revolution did not immediately result in a republican form of government, but rather the establishment of a provisional central government over a weak country remained politically fragmented. The monarchy was abolished and briefly restored twice, and there was a period of military rule. Though the revolution concluded on February 12, 1912, when the Republic of China formally replaced the Qing Dynasty, internal conflict persisted with civil begetting until the official creation of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949. The Chinese Revolution was the first attempt to establish a republic in China, which succeeded in overthrowing the previous government.</p><p>

It's a socialist republic ruled by the Communist Party of China under a single-party system and has jurisdiction over twenty-two provinces, five autonomous regions such as Tibet and two Special Administrative Regions with great autonomy: Hong Kong and Macau. The capital of China is Beijing.</p><p>
The People's Republic of China, next to Vietnam, Laos and Cuba, is one of the four remaining states that declare themselves socialists in the world. The economy of China is the second largest in the world. And with over 2.3 million active troops, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the largest military force in the world in terms of number of troops, and has the second largest defense budget in the world, behind only the USA.</p><p>
